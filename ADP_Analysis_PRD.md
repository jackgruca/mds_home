# ADP Analysis Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Implement a comprehensive ADP (Average Draft Position) analysis section that allows users to compare historical draft positions with actual player performance, identify values and busts, and make informed draft decisions.

## Core Features

### 1. Historical ADP vs Performance Analysis
- Display player ADP from 2015-2025
- Show actual finish rank for completed seasons
- Support both PPR and Standard scoring formats
- Toggle between total points and points per game (PPG) rankings

### 2. Data Metrics
- **ADP Data**: Average rank plus platform-specific ranks (CBS, Sleeper, ESPN, NFL, RTS, FFC)
- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Final rank by total points
  - Final rank by PPG
  - Points scored
  - Games played
- **Comparison Metrics**:
  - Numeric difference (e.g., "Drafted 15th, Finished 5th = +10")
  - Percentage difference
  - Current year ADP vs previous year finish

### 3. User Interface Elements
- **Filtering Options**:
  - Year selector (2015-2025)
  - Position filter (All, QB, RB, WR, TE)
  - Scoring format toggle (PPR/Standard)
  - Ranking type toggle (Total Points/PPG)
- **Search**: Player name search across all years
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Green highlighting for values (outperformed ADP by 15+ spots)
  - Red highlighting for busts (underperformed ADP by 15+ spots)
  - Neutral for expected performance (within ±15 spots)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Pipeline Setup (Week 1)
**Objective**: Establish data collection and storage infrastructure

**Tasks**:
1. **R Script Enhancement**
   - Combine the three R code sections into single script
   - Add standard scoring calculations alongside PPR
   - Export data as CSV files:
     - `historical_adp_standard.csv`
     - `historical_adp_ppr.csv`
     - `player_performance_ppr.csv`
     - `player_performance_standard.csv`
   - Add player ID matching logic for consistent identification

2. **Data Storage Structure**
   - Create `/assets/data/adp/` directory
   - Store CSV files with yearly data
   - Include metadata file with last update timestamp

3. **Initial Data Load**
   - Run R script to generate 2015-2025 data
   - Validate data completeness
   - Handle missing player matches

### Phase 2: Core ADP Page Development (Week 2)
**Objective**: Build dedicated ADP analysis page with basic functionality

**Tasks**:
1. **Data Models**
   - Create `ADPData` model class
   - Create `PlayerPerformance` model class
   - Create `ADPComparison` model for joined data

2. **Data Service**
   - Build `ADPService` to load and parse CSV data
   - Implement player matching logic
   - Cache processed data for performance

3. **Basic UI Implementation**
   - Create `/adp` route and page
   - Implement data table with columns:
     - Rank
     - Player Name
     - Position
     - Team
     - ADP (with platform breakdown on hover/tap)
     - Final Rank
     - Difference (+/-)
     - Points
     - PPG
   - Add year selector dropdown
   - Add position filter buttons

4. **Navigation Integration**
   - Add ADP option to main navigation
   - Create appropriate routing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
**Objective**: Add filtering, search, and visual enhancements

**Tasks**:
1. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Implement PPR/Standard toggle
   - Add Total Points/PPG ranking toggle
   - Create player search functionality
   - Add multi-column sorting

2. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Implement color coding for values/busts:
     - Deep green: Outperformed by 30+ spots
     - Light green: Outperformed by 15-29 spots
     - Neutral: Within ±14 spots
     - Light red: Underperformed by 15-29 spots
     - Deep red: Underperformed by 30+ spots
   - Add sparkline charts for historical trends
   - Create hover states showing platform-specific ADPs

3. **Performance Comparisons**
   - Add "This Year vs Last Year" view
   - Show percentage changes
   - Highlight biggest risers/fallers

4. **Data Export**
   - Add ability to export filtered data as CSV
   - Share functionality for specific insights

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Week 4)
**Objective**: Integrate with existing features and optimize performance

**Tasks**:
1. **Player Page Integration**
   - Add ADP history section to individual player pages
   - Show player's historical ADP trend chart
   - Display best/worst ADP value seasons

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for large datasets
   - Add data pagination
   - Optimize search with debouncing

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Ensure table is scrollable on mobile
   - Create mobile-optimized view with key metrics
   - Add swipe gestures for year navigation

4. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Unit tests for data processing
   - Integration tests for filters
   - User documentation for interpreting metrics

## Technical Specifications

### Data Schema

**ADP Data CSV Structure**:
```csv
player_id,player,position,team,season,espn_rank,sleeper_rank,cbs_rank,nfl_rank,rts_rank,ffc_rank,avg_rank
```

**Performance Data CSV Structure**:
```csv
player_id,player,position,season,points_ppr,points_std,ppg_ppr,ppg_std,games_played,final_rank_ppr,final_rank_std
```

### State Management
- Use Provider or Riverpod for:
  - Selected year
  - Selected position filter
  - Scoring format (PPR/Standard)
  - Ranking type (Total/PPG)
  - Search query

### Caching Strategy
- Cache processed CSV data in memory on first load
- Refresh cache when switching between PPR/Standard
- Store user preferences (default view settings)

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Search response time < 100ms
- Data accuracy: 95%+ player matching rate
- User engagement: 3+ minutes average session time

## Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)
- Dynasty league ADP tracking
- Rookie-only ADP analysis
- Custom scoring format support
- ADP trends throughout offseason
- Machine learning predictions for ADP accuracy
- Integration with draft optimizer tools
- Real-time ADP updates during draft season

## Weekly Maintenance
- Run R script weekly for next 4 weeks to capture ADP movement
- After Week 4, switch to monthly updates until next season
- Monitor for data source changes (FantasyPros HTML structure)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Source Changes**: Maintain fallback to previous data if scraping fails
- **Player Matching**: Implement fuzzy matching for name variations
- **Performance**: Use virtualized lists for large datasets
- **Mobile Experience**: Progressive enhancement approach
