# MDS Home: Project & Roadmap Document

**Document Version:** 3.0
**Date:** July 12, 2024

## 1. Vision Statement

To build the ultimate, tool-centric platform for the modern NFL fan. We will empower users by democratizing advanced data and seamlessly bridging the worlds of fantasy football, "Be a GM" team management, and sports betting. Our success will be defined by creating "sticky," engaging, community-powered tools that help fans get smarter and find a unique edge.

## 2. Core User Problems & Target Audience

Our target users are "high-information" NFL fans who currently have to stitch together multiple, disconnected services to satisfy their needs.

*   **The Armchair GM:** Loves the NFL draft, team building, and salary cap strategy.
    *   *Problem:* They use content sites like WalterFootball but lack interactive tools. They reference data on Spotrac but can't *act* on it.
*   **The Fantasy Football Power User:** Plays in multiple leagues (especially dynasty) and seeks a competitive advantage.
    *   *Problem:* They use basic fantasy tools but crave deeper, data-driven insights. They use KeepTradeCut for one thing, but have no way to integrate that with "real GM" data or their other tools.
*   **The Aspiring Sports Bettor:** Wants to move beyond simple picks and develop their own data-driven betting strategies.
    *   *Problem:* They are served content by sites like Action Network but are not empowered with the underlying data or tools to do their own analysis.

**Our core thesis is that these are not three different users, but three facets of the *same* user.**

## 3. Values Delivered to Users

This is the "why" behind our platform. Every feature should map back to one or more of these core values.

*   **Find Your Edge:** We provide data and tools that are unavailable or difficult to use elsewhere, giving you a tangible advantage in your fantasy league, GM simulations, and bets.
*   **See the Whole Field:** We bridge the gaps between fantasy, real-world team management (contracts, trades), and betting, providing a holistic view that no competitor offers.
*   **Get Smarter, Faster:** We democratize complex data through intuitive design and a tool-first philosophy, allowing you to get to the "so what" faster than ever before.
*   **Build Your Legacy:** We enable deep, multi-year experiences through our "Be a GM" and Dynasty fantasy tools, allowing you to build something that lasts.
*   **Join the Community:** We build tools that are inherently social, making it easy to share your analysis, learn from others, and prove your knowledge.

## 5. The Monetization Framework: How We'll Figure Out What to Charge For

This is a step-by-step process to de-risk your monetization strategy. We will not guess what's valuable; we will let users show us.

1.  **Step 1: Provide Overwhelming Free Value (Current Stage).** Build best-in-class tools and give them away for free. The goal is to build trust, a user base, and a reputation as an indispensable resource.
2.  **Step 2: Measure Engagement & Identify Power Users.** Use simple analytics to track which features are used most often. Who are the 100 users who have run the most mock drafts or created the most custom cheat sheets? These are your power users.
3.  **Step 3: The "Early Supporter" Test.** Once you have a small, loyal user base (e.g., 1,000+ newsletter subscribers or monthly active users), add a simple, one-time "$5 Supporter" button. Frame it as "Help support the site's development and get a 'Founding Member' badge on your profile." This is a low-friction test to see if people value the platform enough to pay *anything* for it.
4.  **Step 4: Survey Your Supporters.** Personally email the first 50 people who become supporters. Ask them two simple questions: "1. What is the single most valuable thing about this site for you? 2. If you could have one more feature, what would it be?" Their answers are your treasure map.
5.  **Step 5: Launch a "Pro" Tier.** Based on your engagement data and user feedback, bundle the top 2-3 most-used or most-requested features into a "Pro" subscription. This could be advanced analytics, the "Draft War Room" tool, or the "Be a GM" Simulator. By this point, you are no longer guessing; you are confident you're building something people will pay for.

## 6. The Content Creation Framework

This is a simple, repeatable process for creating high-quality, data-driven content for your newsletter and social media, establishing you as an authority.

1.  **The Question:** Start each week with a simple, interesting question. (e.g., *“Which rookie WR is getting the most valuable (red zone) targets?”* or *“Which team’s defense is giving up the most points to a specific position?”*)
2.  **The Data:** Use your `nflverse` scripts to pull the relevant data to answer that one question.
3.  **The Insight:** State the answer in one clear, concise sentence. (*“Rookie WR X has seen 8 red zone targets in the last 3 weeks, the most of any rookie.”*)
4.  **The "So What":** Explain why this matters in 1-2 sentences. (*“This suggests he’s becoming his team’s primary scoring threat. He’s a prime trade target in fantasy and his touchdown props are looking valuable.”*)
5.  **The Visual:** Create one clean chart or table that proves your point.
6.  **The Cadence:** Publish once a week (e.g., "Data Dive Tuesday"). This builds anticipation and a loyal following.

## 7. Guiding Principles

1.  **Tool-First, Not Content-First:** We build interactive experiences, not static articles. Content exists to support the tools, not the other way around.
2.  **Democratize Data:** Make complex data accessible and actionable for the average fan through superior UI/UX.
3.  **Community-Powered:** Our tools should be the social object. Enable users to share, discuss, and learn from each other's analysis.
4.  **Build Bridges, Not Silos:** Create a unified experience where insights from one area (e.g., player contracts) directly inform decisions in another (e.g., dynasty fantasy).
5.  **Move Fast & Provide Value:** Focus on rapid, iterative development that delivers tangible value to users in every release. Monetization follows value.

## 8. Measuring Success (Key Performance Indicators)

*   **Growth:** Monthly Active Users (MAU), New User Sign-ups.
*   **Engagement:** Mock Drafts Completed, GM Sessions Initiated, Trades Analyzed, "Share" Clicks.
*   **Retention:** Day 7 / Day 30 User Retention, % of Users using more than one tool.
