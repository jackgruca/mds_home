# Ranking Customization & Filtering System Requirements

## Project Overview
Transform the position ranking screens into interactive platforms where users can customize ranking weights, see live updates, and filter data across multiple dimensions.

## Core Objectives
1. **Customizable Rankings**: Allow users to adjust variable weights and see real-time rank updates
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Enable complex queries to compare players, drill into specific data, and analyze cross-sections
3. **Live Updates**: Provide immediate feedback when weights are adjusted
4. **Tier Management**: Automatically re-calculate tiers based on new ranking scores

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Weight Adjustment System

#### UI Components
- **Weight Adjustment Panel**: Collapsible sidebar or modal with sliders/inputs for each ranking variable
- **Live Preview**: Real-time display of updated rankings as weights change
- **Reset Button**: Return to default weights
- **Save/Load**: Persist custom weight configurations

#### Backend Requirements
- **Weight Calculation Engine**: Recalculate `myRank` scores using adjusted weights
- **Formula**: `myRank = Σ(weight_i × rank_i)` where rank_i is the percentile rank for variable i
- **Position-Specific Variables**:
  - **QB**: EPA, EP, CPOE, YPG, TD, Actualization, INT, Third Down
  - **RB**: EPA, TD, Rush Share, YPG, Target Share, Third Down, RZ, Explosive, RYOE, Efficiency
  - **WR**: EPA, TD, Target Share, YPG, RZ, Explosive, Separation, Air Yards, Catch%, Third Down, YAC+
  - **TE**: EPA, TD, Target Share, YPG, RZ, Explosive, Separation, Air Yards, Catch%, Third Down, YAC+

#### Data Flow
1. User adjusts weight slider
2. Frontend sends new weights to calculation engine
3. Engine recalculates `myRank` for all players
4. Results sorted by new `myRank` values
5. Tiers recalculated based on new rankings
6. UI updates with new order and tier assignments

### 2. Advanced Filtering System

#### Filter Categories
- **Player Filters**: Name search, team, position, tier
- **Statistical Filters**: Range filters for any numeric stat (EPA, YPG, etc.)
- **Temporal Filters**: Season, week ranges, year-over-year comparisons
- **Comparative Filters**: Compare specific players side-by-side
- **Tier Analysis**: Filter by tier across multiple seasons

#### UI Components
- **Filter Panel**: Collapsible section with organized filter categories
- **Query Builder**: Visual interface for building complex queries
- **Saved Queries**: Save and load frequently used filter combinations
- **Export Results**: Download filtered data as CSV/JSON

#### Filter Operations
- **Range Filters**: Min/max values for numeric fields
- **Multi-Select**: Choose multiple teams, positions, tiers
- **Text Search**: Fuzzy search on player names
- **Boolean Logic**: AND/OR combinations of filters
- **Cross-Season Analysis**: Compare same player across different years

### 3. Player Comparison System

#### Side-by-Side Comparison
- **Compare Mode**: Select 2-4 players for detailed comparison
- **Stat Matrix**: Display all relevant stats in comparison table
- **Visual Indicators**: Highlight differences, strengths, weaknesses
- **Export Comparison**: Save comparison results

#### Drill-Down Analysis
- **Player Detail Modal**: Comprehensive view of individual player
- **Historical Trends**: Show player performance over time
- **Stat Breakdown**: Detailed view of each ranking component
- **Projection Analysis**: Historical performance patterns

### 4. Tier Management System

#### Dynamic Tier Calculation
- **Tier Rules**: Automatically assign tiers based on ranking position
- **Customizable Tiers**: Allow users to define custom tier boundaries
- **Visual Indicators**: Color coding and tier labels
- **Tier Analysis**: Filter and analyze by tier across seasons

#### Tier Assignment Logic
```dart
// Example tier assignment
int assignTier(int rankNum) {
  if (rankNum <= 4) return 1;
  if (rankNum <= 8) return 2;
  if (rankNum <= 12) return 3;
  if (rankNum <= 16) return 4;
  if (rankNum <= 20) return 5;
  if (rankNum <= 24) return 6;
  if (rankNum <= 28) return 7;
  return 8;
}
```
