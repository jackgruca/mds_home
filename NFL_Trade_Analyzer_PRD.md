- ✅ **Player Data**: CSV with 1,547 active NFL players
- ✅ **Contracts**: AAV, years remaining, contract status
- ✅ **Team Needs**: Import from existing CSV
- **Draft Picks**: Generate standard pick values

#### 4.2 Valuation Engine
```dart
class TradeValuationService {
  static double calculatePlayerValue(NFLPlayer player, NFLTeamInfo receivingTeam) {
    double baseValue = player.marketValue;
    double ageMultiplier = _getAgeMultiplier(player.age, player.position);
    double skillPercentile = player.overallRating / 100.0;
    double teamNeedWeight = receivingTeam.getPositionNeed(player.position);
    
    return baseValue * ageMultiplier * skillPercentile * teamNeedWeight;
  }
  
  static double calculateTradeBalance(TeamTradePackage team1, TeamTradePackage team2) {
    double team1Value = team1.calculateTotalValue();
    double team2Value = team2.calculateTotalValue();
    return team2Value / team1Value; // 1.0 = perfect balance
  }
}
```

#### 4.3 Cap Space Validation
```dart
class CapSpaceValidator {
  static TradeValidation validateTrade(TeamTradePackage team1, TeamTradePackage team2) {
    // Calculate net cap impact for each team
    // Check against available cap space
    // Return validation result with warnings/blocks
  }
}
```

  static List<TradeSuggestion> generateSuggestions(TradeScenario trade) {
    // "Cowboys unlikely to trade star player for picks only"
    // "Consider adding 2025 2nd round pick to balance values"
