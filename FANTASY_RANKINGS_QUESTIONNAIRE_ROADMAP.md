# Fantasy Football Player Rankings Questionnaire - Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision

Create an intuitive, user-friendly standalone questionnaire system accessible from the Fantasy Hub that allows fantasy football users to build custom player rankings based on their preferred statistical attributes and weightings. The system will leverage existing FF rankings CSV data and previous season stats to generate both individual stat rankings and an aggregate consensus ranking, with comprehensive post-creation adjustment capabilities. This feature will serve as a lead magnet requiring authentication for saving rankings.

- **Dynamic Ranking Generation**: Real-time calculation of individual and aggregate rankings
- **Comprehensive Adjustments**: Add/remove attributes, modify weights, real-time ranking updates
- **Position Support**: QB, WR, RB, TE with position-specific attribute sets
- **Authentication Integration**: Required for saving rankings (lead magnet strategy)
- **Export & Sharing**: Export rankings and share custom methodologies

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Rankings generated in <2 seconds
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface suitable for casual fantasy players
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-friendly design
- **Data Integration**: Leverage existing FF rankings CSV and previous season statistical data
- **Authentication Flow**: Seamless login requirement for save functionality
