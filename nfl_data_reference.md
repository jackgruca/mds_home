## ðŸ”— JOIN STRATEGIES

### Universal Join Keys

**Player Analysis Joins:**
```r
# Primary: player_name + season (most reliable)
pbp %>% left_join(rosters, by = c("passer_player_name" = "player_name", "season"))

# Secondary: gsis_id (when available)
rosters %>% left_join(combine, by = c("gsis_id" = "pfr_id"))

# Tertiary: Fuzzy matching for name variations
```

**Game Analysis Joins:**
```r
# Primary: game_id (most datasets)
pbp %>% left_join(schedules, by = "game_id")

# Secondary: team + season + week + date
schedules %>% left_join(injuries, by = c("home_team" = "team", "season", "week"))
```

**Team Analysis Joins:**
```r
# Standard team abbreviations work across most datasets
pbp %>% left_join(schedules, by = c("posteam" = "home_team", "game_id"))
```

### Common Field Name Mappings

**Player Identifiers:**
- `gsis_id` = `player_id` (in some contexts)
- `passer_player_name` = `player_name` = `player_display_name`
- `fantasy_player_name` = cleaned version of `player_name`

**Team Identifiers:**
- `posteam` = `team` = `home_team`/`away_team`
- Team abbreviations standardized across datasets

**Time Identifiers:**
- `season` + `week` universal across datasets
- `game_date` format: YYYY-MM-DD
- `gameday` in schedules = `game_date` in pbp

### Multi-Dataset Analysis Examples

**QB Under Pressure Analysis:**
```r
# Combine: PBP + NGS + Rosters
pbp_pressure <- pbp %>% 
  filter(qb_hit == 1 | was_pressure == 1) %>%
  left_join(ngs_passing, by = c("passer_player_name" = "player_display_name", "season", "week")) %>%
  left_join(rosters, by = c("passer_player_name" = "player_name", "season"))
```

**Draft Pick Value Analysis:**
```r
# Combine: Draft + Rosters + Player Stats
draft_value <- draft_picks %>%
  left_join(rosters, by = c("pfr_player_name" = "player_name")) %>%
  left_join(player_stats, by = c("player_name", "season"))
```

**Weather Impact on Passing:**
```r
# Combine: PBP + Schedules + NGS
weather_passing <- pbp %>%
  filter(pass == 1) %>%
  left_join(schedules, by = "game_id") %>%
  left_join(ngs_passing, by = c("passer_player_name" = "player_display_name", "season", "week"))
```

## âš¡ EFFICIENCY TIPS

### Quick Data Checks
```r
# Always verify data availability first
table(pbp_2024$season, pbp_2024$week)  # Check coverage
length(unique(rosters_2024$player_name))  # Player count
colnames(ngs_passing)[grepl("time|throw", colnames(ngs_passing))]  # Find relevant fields
```

### Common Filters
```r
# Regular season only
filter(season_type == "REG")

# Exclude preseason/special teams
filter(play_type %in% c("pass", "run"))

# Minimum attempt thresholds
filter(attempts >= 100)  # For QB analysis
filter(targets >= 50)    # For WR analysis
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Large datasets:** Use `slice_sample()` for development
- **Multiple seasons:** Filter early in pipeline
- **Memory management:** Select only needed columns upfront
- **Join efficiency:** Use smaller dataset as primary table when possible

## ðŸš¨ DATA LIMITATIONS & GOTCHAS

### Known Issues
- **2009-2011:** Limited advanced metrics in early nflfastR years
- **Player names:** Spelling variations across datasets require fuzzy matching
- **Team relocations:** Handle team abbreviation changes (LAR, LV, etc.)
- **Missing NGS:** Not all players/games have Next Gen Stats coverage
- **Combine participation:** Not all draft picks participated in combine

### Quality Checks
```r
# Check for data gaps
pbp %>% count(season, week, sort = TRUE)

# Verify join success rates
left_join_result %>% summarise(join_rate = mean(!is.na(joined_field)))

# Identify outliers
player_stats %>% filter(passing_yards > 6000)  # Unrealistic values
```
