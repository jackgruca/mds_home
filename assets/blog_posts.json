          "content": "If you love the NFL Draft, chances are you'll love mock draft simulators. And if you don't yet, it probably just means you haven't tried one.\n\nThe draft is unpredictable — that's what makes it so fun to watch. But (most) team have a process or logic behind the decisions they make: value, need, positional depth, upside.

And if you're a college football fan? It's the perfect bridge to the NFL — follow your favorite prospects all the way through to draft weekend.\n\nBottom line: Get in the driver's seat.
